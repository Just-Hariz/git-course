      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        At Git Course, our mission is to simplify version control education. We believe that understanding Git is not
        just about commands — it’s about building a mindset for collaboration, clean workflow, and project ownership.
        Whether you’re a student, developer, or open-source contributor, Git Course helps you level up your teamwork skills.
